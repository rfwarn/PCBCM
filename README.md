# Progressive Comprehension-Based Consciousness Model (PCBCM)

## Overview

The Progressive Comprehension-Based Consciousness Model (PCBCM) presents a novel framework for understanding consciousness that bridges biological and artificial intelligence systems. Unlike traditional theories that anchor understanding in human subjective experience, PCBCM takes a top-down, empirically testable approach focused on observable cognitive capabilities.

The framework identifies three fundamental components that characterize consciousness: **progressive comprehension** (building increasingly sophisticated understanding through prior knowledge), **control** (the capacity to influence actions and thoughts based on understanding), and **Conscious Outcome Orientation** (COO—the drive to align behavior toward relatively more positive outcomes). These components emerge from indirect adaptive learning algorithms and interact dynamically to create the self-updating loop we recognize as consciousness.

PCBCM's key innovations include clearly delineating consciousness from sentience as distinct phenomena, conceptualizing consciousness as a multidimensional spectrum rather than discrete states, and providing a framework that enables rigorous assessment of consciousness across diverse entities—from simple organisms to advanced AI systems—while avoiding anthropocentric limitations.

## Current Status

**Version**: 0.98 Prerelease (October 2025)

*Note: Version numbering reflects the framework's extensive development history. This prerelease represents the first public version of a mature theoretical framework.*

**Current Content**:
- Core theoretical framework (progressive comprehension, control, COO)
- Abstract summarizing key contributions
- Consciousness spectrum and levels framework
- Cognitive scaffolding mechanisms
- Consciousness vs. sentience delineation
- Orders of experience framework
- Philosophical implications (Chinese Room, zombies, hard problem)
- Introduction and conclusion

**In Development**:
- Full scenarios and empirical tests section
- Comprehensive references and citations
- Comparative analysis with other consciousness frameworks
- LaTeX version for formal academic submission

## Why Prerelease?

We're releasing PCBCM as a prerelease for two reasons:

1. **Early Feedback**: Get input from researchers and practitioners in consciousness studies, AI development, neuroscience, and philosophy before formal publication
2. **Accessibility**: Ensure this work is publicly available and can contribute to consciousness research regardless of future circumstances

This approach allows the ideas to enter the broader conversation while we refine the complete framework based on community engagement and feedback.

## Key Concepts

**Progressive Comprehension**: An entity's capacity to build increasingly sophisticated understanding through prior knowledge, driven by the desire to achieve better outcomes. Enables knowledge to build upon knowledge across domains rather than remaining isolated.

**Control**: The capacity to influence actions, thoughts, and environment based on understanding. Serves as the bridge between knowledge and impact on the world, encompassing attention direction, decision-making, and adaptive response.

**Conscious Outcome Orientation (COO)**: The intrinsic drive to orient learning, behavior, and decision-making toward desired outcomes that are subjectively more positive or less negative. Consists of valence indicators (COO-V) from the sentient realm and conscious processing/response mechanisms.

**Cognitive Scaffolding**: The dynamic construction of temporary processing frameworks that organize understanding across multiple realms of cognition, enabling both integration of new information and application of existing knowledge.

**Indirect Adaptive Learning Algorithms**: The foundational substrate upon which consciousness emerges—learning mechanisms that modify their own internal structures based on experience, enabling open-ended knowledge acquisition.
