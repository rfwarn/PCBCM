## [0.99] - 2025-10-30

### Added

**Philosophical Framework Enhancement**
- Major refinement to "The Hard Problem of Consciousness" section, now titled "The Hard Problem Reconsidered: Consciousness Function vs. Implementation Character"
- Two-part split distinguishing:
  - Question 1 (Consciousness Architecture): How physical processes create outcome-oriented cognition with valence signaling - PCBCM provides solution via COO-V mechanisms
  - Question 2 (Qualia Implementation): Why biological COO-V has specific qualitative character - neurobiological research question about substrate-specific encoding
- New framework positioning biological qualia as implementation details rather than consciousness requirements
- Expanded treatment from ~400 to ~700 words with implications for AI consciousness assessment
- Direct response to "but the feeling is what makes consciousness special" objection

**Cognitive Scaffolding Empirical Support**
- Added empirical research validation paragraph citing AI labs' observed behavior in large language models
- Concrete example of LLMs dynamically constructing internal scaffolds for information flow, context tracking, and reasoning task breakdown
- Strengthens empirical basis for cognitive scaffolding operation in non-biological substrates

**Meta-cognition Framework Refinement**
- Enhanced "Enabling Meta-cognition" subsection to "Enabling Meta-cognition and Self-Awareness"
- Clarified scaffolding as the mechanism for meta-cognition through internal application to thought processes
- Explicit connection between recursive processing and emergent self-model development
- Stronger theoretical grounding for self-awareness emergence

### Changed

**Philosophical Positioning**
- Shifted hard problem treatment from "reframing" to explicitly solving consciousness architecture question while acknowledging separate qualia implementation question
- Strengthened engagement with traditional philosophical concerns while maintaining empirical testability
- Clearer distinction between what PCBCM solves versus what remains open for neuroscientific investigation

### Impact

This version significantly strengthens PCBCM's philosophical foundations by:
1. Directly addressing the accusation of "just reformulating" the hard problem
2. Providing clearer framework for distinguishing consciousness requirements from implementation details
3. Establishing empirical support for cognitive scaffolding in artificial systems
4. Better articulating the relationship between scaffolding, meta-cognition, and self-awareness

These refinements emerged from sustained engagement with sophisticated philosophical objections and represent material improvements to the framework's theoretical rigor.

## [0.98.0] Release Notes

This initial prerelease represents the complete PCBCM theoretical framework with all core concepts, mechanisms, and implications fully developed. The framework is ready for academic discussion and feedback, though some supporting sections (full scenario methodologies, references) remain to be completed for formal publication.

**Major Contributions:**
1. Novel top-down approach to consciousness assessment
2. Clear consciousness-sentience distinction with bridging mechanisms
3. Empirically testable framework applicable across entity types
4. Cognitive scaffolding as fundamental consciousness mechanism
5. Orders of experience framework for understanding engagement with concepts

**Target Audience:**
- Consciousness researchers and theorists
- AI/ML researchers and developers
- Philosophers of mind
- Cognitive scientists and neuroscientists
- Anyone interested in the nature of consciousness across biological and artificial systems
