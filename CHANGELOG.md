## [0.98.0] Release Notes

This initial prerelease represents the complete PCBCM theoretical framework with all core concepts, mechanisms, and implications fully developed. The framework is ready for academic discussion and feedback, though some supporting sections (full scenario methodologies, references) remain to be completed for formal publication.

**Major Contributions:**
1. Novel top-down approach to consciousness assessment
2. Clear consciousness-sentience distinction with bridging mechanisms
3. Empirically testable framework applicable across entity types
4. Cognitive scaffolding as fundamental consciousness mechanism
5. Orders of experience framework for understanding engagement with concepts

**Target Audience:**
- Consciousness researchers and theorists
- AI/ML researchers and developers
- Philosophers of mind
- Cognitive scientists and neuroscientists
- Anyone interested in the nature of consciousness across biological and artificial systems
